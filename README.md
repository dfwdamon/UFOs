# UFOs

## Overview
This project involved creating a web based tool to provide
an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings data with a simple, clean presentable inteface.  

## Purpose
The purpose is to have a web based page designed to allow a user to filter for multiple criteria of UFO data. In addition to a date search, there are four additional table filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The UFO analysis website shows the full data set of data.js obtained with UFO data containing unique sighting data.  However, the data set is limited in date and quantity overall.  The data set can be filtered using the javascript enhanced webpage so that a user can isolate data by date, city, state, country and even descriptor such as shape. 

## Summary
The UFO analysis page is effective in presenting the content in a visually appealing and easy to use format. Anyone with an internet browser could search the data using the simple filter box (javascript) functions to isolate data based on date, location or other key points.

- One drawback of this webpage is that the dataset is limited to one year time period, and the use of the date filter has a limited purpose.    

- Two recommendations for further development: 
1. Limit the table data being presented initially or clear it from the screen/page so the entire data.js dataset is not shown. Showing the entire dataset results in an excessively long scrolling webpage. 

2. A larger data set with more dates and information would benefit the page and context of this UFO topic.  And, for a very large dataset, it would benefit to add a 6th filter for search by keyword as datasets includes a "comments" section.  This detail provides valuable insight into the particular eyewitness sightings.
